        <h4>The Problem</h4>

          <p>People are not thinking about gum. Coming off five consecutive years of
          $ growth, in 2020, EXTRA US (the category leader) has seen sales significantly
          impacted by COVID-19. EXTRA needs work that clearly communicates how gum
          fits into (and possibly fuels) peopleâ€™s daily lives.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>

          <p>We found a commonality between Extra and students: they're both struggling
          to adapt to the new norm created by COVID-19. Students can be easily distracted
          and unmotivated to make it through the semester when much of it is online.</p>

          <p>Since gum is proven to improve concentration, we created "Extra Focus,"
          an intiative that helps students build of maintain good study habits and
          encourage their friends to do the same.</p>
