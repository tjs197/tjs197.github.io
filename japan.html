        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>In 1603, after decades of civil warfare, the Tokugawa shogunate
          (a military-led, dynastic government) ushered in a long period of
          relative political stability and isolation from foreign influence.
          For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to enjoy a
          flowering of its indigenous culture. Japan opened its ports after
          signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 and began to
          intensively modernize and industrialize.</p>

        <p>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan became a
          regional power that was able to defeat the forces of both China and
          Russia. It occupied Korea, Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin
          Island. In 1931-32 Japan occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched
          a full-scale invasion of China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 -
          triggering America's entry into World War II - and soon occupied much
          of East and Southeast Asia.</p>

        <p>After its defeat in World War II, Japan recovered to become an
          economic power and an ally of the US. While the emperor retains his
          throne as a symbol of national unity, elected politicians hold actual
          decision-making power. Following three decades of unprecedented
          growth, Japan's economy experienced a major slowdown starting in the
          1990s, but the country remains an economic power.</p>

        <p>In March 2011, Japan's strongest-ever earthquake, and an accompanying
           tsunami, devastated the northeast part of Honshu island, killed
           thousands, and damaged several nuclear power plants. Prime Minister
           Shinzo ABE was reelected to office in December 2012, and has since
           embarked on ambitious economic and security reforms to improve
           Japan's economy and bolster the country's international standing.
           In November 2019, ABE became Japan's longest-serving post-war prime
           minister.</p>

        <h2>Economy</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>Over the past 70 years, government-industry cooperation, a strong work
          ethic, mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
          allocation (slightly less than 1% of GDP) have helped Japan develop an
          advanced economy. Two notable characteristics of the post-World War II
          economy were the close interlocking structures of manufacturers, suppliers,
          and distributors, known as <em>keiretsu</em>, and the guarantee of lifetime
          employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor force. Both
          features have significantly eroded under the dual pressures of global
          competition and domestic demographic change.</p>

        <p>Measured on a purchasing power parity basis that adjusts for price differences,
          Japan in 2017 stood as the fourth-largest economy in the world after
          first-place China, which surpassed Japan in 2001, and third-place India,
          which edged out Japan in 2012. For three postwar decades, overall real
          economic growth was impressive - averaging 10% in the 1960s, 5% in the
          1970s, and 4% in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s,
          averaging just 1.7%, largely because of the aftereffects of inefficient
          investment and the collapse of an asset price bubble in the late 1980s,
          which resulted in several years of economic stagnation as firms sought
          to reduce excess debt, capital, and labor. Modest economic growth continued after 2000,
          but the economy has fallen into recession four times since 2008.</p>

        <p>Japan enjoyed an uptick in growth since 2013, supported by Prime Minister
          Shinzo ABE’s "Three Arrows" economic revitalization agenda - dubbed "Abenomics"
          - of monetary easing, "flexible" fiscal policy, and structural reform.
          Led by the Bank of Japan’s aggressive monetary easing, Japan is making
          modest progress in ending deflation, but demographic decline – a low
          birthrate and an aging, shrinking population – poses a major long-term
          challenge for the economy. The government currently faces the quandary of
          balancing its efforts to stimulate growth and institute economic reforms
          with the need to address its sizable public debt, which stands at 235% of GDP.
          To help raise government revenue, Japan adopted legislation in 2012 to gradually
          raise the consumption tax rate. However, the first such increase, in April
          2014, led to a sharp contraction, so Prime Minister ABE has twice postponed
          the next increase, which is now scheduled for October 2019. Structural reforms
          to unlock productivity are seen as central to strengthening the economy
          in the long-run.</p>

        <p>Scarce in critical natural resources, Japan has long been dependent on
          imported energy and raw materials. After the complete shutdown of Japan’s
          nuclear reactors following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in 2011,
          Japan's industrial sector has become even more dependent than before on
          imported fossil fuels. However, ABE’s government is seeking to restart
          nuclear power plants that meet strict new safety standards and is
          emphasizing nuclear energy’s importance as a base-load electricity source.
          In August 2015, Japan successfully restarted one nuclear reactor at the
          Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima prefecture, and several other
          reactors around the country have since resumed operations; however,
          opposition from local governments has delayed several more restarts that
          remain pending. Reforms of the electricity and gas sectors, including full
          liberalization of Japan’s energy market in April 2016 and gas market in
          April 2017, constitute an important part of Prime Minister Abe’s economic program.</p>

        <p>Under the Abe Administration, Japan’s government sought to open the country’s
          economy to greater foreign competition and create new export opportunities
          for Japanese businesses, including by joining 11 trading partners in the
          Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Japan became the first country to ratify
          the TPP in December 2016, but the United States signaled its withdrawal
          from the agreement in January 2017. In November 2017 the remaining 11
          countries agreed on the core elements of a modified agreement, which they
          renamed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
          Partnership (CPTPP). Japan also reached agreement with the European Union
          on an Economic Partnership Agreement in July 2017, and is likely seek to
          ratify both agreements in the Diet this year.</p>
