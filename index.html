    <h1>Tiyah Snell</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Tiyah Snell and I am a junior studying Creative Advertising at the University of Miami. I am taking this class to gain knowledge and skill in building websites. I would like to eventually offer website design to my list of services for my brand design business. This is not my first web page, but it is the first web page I have created on my own! I love that we've already hit the ground running in class and that the fast pace of this course requires more from me. </p>
