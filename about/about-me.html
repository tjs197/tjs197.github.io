          <h3>Hi! I'm Tiyah (pronounced tie-yuh)</h3>
          <p>On paper, I am a graphic designer, content creator, and social media
             marketer; but my friends know me as an astrology guru, twitter-enthusiast,
             and workaholic. Anyone that knows me knows that I give 110% to everything that I do.</p>

          <p>As a Creative Advertising student at the University of Miami, I aim to
            constantly challenge myself creatively. I function best when I have
            multiple projects that I’m working on at once, and when I can diversify
            my workload. When I’m not working on new projects, I’m likely planning
            programs to engage multicultural and diverse students on campus.</p>

          <p>My motivation is my dream of combining my passion for diversity, equity,
            and inclusion work with design to increase authentic representation in
            advertising. If even just one young creative can be affirmed and motivated
            by seeing me pursuing this less-than-traditional field, I will be fulfilled.</p>
